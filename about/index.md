## I’m Aceler Chua, a designer who focuses on producing problem-solving solutions in various creative ways.

My design approach involves—but not limited to—visual design, human interaction design and typography.

I founded The Missing Bulb, a tiny design studio focused on solving problems with great design. Hire us by dropping by our [website](http://themissingbulb.com).

I am also the Design & Tech Lead of [Philippine Web Designers Organization](http://pwdo.org) since 2013. I’m usually in charge of creating identities and websites for events we organize, like [Form, Function & Class](http://formfunctionclass.com).
