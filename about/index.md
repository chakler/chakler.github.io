## I am Aceler Chua, a multidisciplinary designer who creates brand identities, user interfaces & typefaces.

Aside from my usual role as a designer, I'm also a front end web developer and a guy working on a lot of weird ideas.

I founded The Missing Bulb, a tiny design studio focused on solving problems with great design. Hire us by dropping by our [website](http://themissingbulb.com).

I am also the Design & Tech Lead of [Philippine Web Designers Organization](http://pwdo.org) since 2013. Iâ€™m usually in charge of creating identities and websites for events we organize, like [Form, Function & Class](http://formfunctionclass.com).
