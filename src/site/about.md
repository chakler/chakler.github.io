# About me

I am Aceler Chua, I’m a designer of typefaces, producer of fonts, and maker of websites.

## On type

Good letterform and typography improves communication; I have always been an advocate of good typography. I’ve been doing consultancy work with clients, advising on improving the typography in logos, books, and websites. I’ve also conducted talks and workshops to introduce typography to different audiences.

My obsessed with typefaces has led me into producing my own fonts. With [Grayscale](https://grayscale.com.hk), I’ve released [Farro](https://playground.grayscale.design/farro), an olive, humanist typeface.

The production of another two typefaces—Ania, a straightforward calligraphic slab serif; and Twardo, a Polish road-sign inspired geometric sans—has been on-going and will be released in the near future.

## On web

Another area of expertise of mine is making websites. Throughout the years, I’ve been able to design and develop websites for clients ranging from start ups to corporates from different nations, with products as simple as basic HTML, JS, and CSS, to single-page application built with framework like Vue.js.

I had the pleasure to lead the Design and Tech team of the [Philippines Web Designers Organization](https://pwdo.org). During the terms I served, I am responsible for conceptualising and producing the brand identity and the website of the organization's currently on hiatus annual conference — [\<form\> function() & .class](https://scrapbook.formfunctionclass.com).
