## I’m Aceler Chua, a designer who focuses on producing problem-solving solutions in various creative ways.

My design approach involves—but not limited to—visual design, human interaction design and typography.

I founded *The Missing Bulb*, a multidisciplinary design studio focusing on creating problem-solving design solutions with an experimental and speculative approach. Hire us by dropping by our [website](http://themissingbulb.com).

With a few awesome friends, we created *Type Philippines* to provide a common ground for all the type enthusiasts. Our aim is to uplift the standard and improve the awareness of typography in the Philippines. Join our type discussions in our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/typeph/).

I was the Design & Tech Lead of *[Philippine Web Designers Organization](http://pwdo.org)* from 2013 to 2015. I used to be in charge of creating identities and websites for events we organize, like [Form, Function & Class](http://formfunctionclass.com).
